It was reactive, like purple, yet proactive, like brown. Best of both worlds? I think the optimal strategy is for each player to go for the closest, lettng the human take the closest if it coincides. While sometimes green was proactive enough to steal the closest first, if i moved toward it, it would quickly seek another diamond. ",5392

It frequently goes for diamonds that are relatively far, but perhaps puts a greater distance between us. The robot sometimes also does not shy away from ""wanting"" a particular diamond even though I was on it. In the end I learned to find one diamond I want to go to and commit to it unless the robot wants it clearly.",3853

This resulted in a bit of chaos and we often were rushing to the same diamond, only to correct our actions later. So I do not think there was a very thought out strategy and I mostly waited for the robot to start towards one goal and I chose one of the remaining ones. ",9343

Knowing this let me predict the robots behavior and adjust my own. I would go for the closest diamond to me that wasnt the diamond the robot was going for. This was an easy collaboration, but maybe not an optimal one.",8544

It felt like it was me working around the robot instead of the robot working around me, but I felt able to adapt quickly. This meant that even though I don't necessarily think we had the most optimized routes, both the robot and I were efficient so we still made up for that loss.",4628
